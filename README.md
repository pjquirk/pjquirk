# About Me

I'm a software engineer who's spent my career building tools and systems that developers rely on. I currently work at [GitHub](https://github.com/github) on the Actions product. Before that I was a part of the Azure DevOps Pipelines team at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft), and earlier in my career I worked at [SportsMEDIA Technology (SMT)](https://smt.com/), [TigerRisk](https://github.com/TigerRisk), and [LexisNexis](https://github.com/LexisNexis).
